## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

   cd road-buddy
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   If you are using npm:

   ```
4. **Install the following Expo packages:**
   ```bash
   npx expo install react-native-maps
   npx expo install expo-location
   ```

## Running the App

Start the Expo development server:
```bash
expo start
```

Run the app on your device or emulator:

- For Android, scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.
- For iOS, scan the QR code with the Camera app or Expo Go app.
- Alternatively, you can run the app on an emulator/simulator:

  - For Android:
    ```bash
    expo start --android
    ```
  - For iOS:
    ```bash
    expo start --ios
    ```


## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions:

- **Expo CLI not recognized:**
  Ensure that you have installed Expo CLI globally. Try running:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

- **App not starting on emulator:**

   Make sure your emulator is running and properly configured. You may need to restart the emulator or your development server.

- **Dependencies issues:**

  Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  ```
